In this repository I will upload the the text and my solutions to the labs of the [Machine Learning course](https://www.kth.se/student/kurser/kurs/DD2421?l=en) held at KTH.
- decision-trees: first lab, the aim is to build, measure performances and prune decison trees.
- SVM: second lab, the aim is to build a support vector machines able to classifiy a two class problem. Different type of kernels were explored.
- baesian classifier: third lab, the aim is to build baesian classifiers and implement boosting by applying the Adaboost algorithm.
- programming_challenge: this is the final project, worth 30% of the final grade. The aim is to build and train a classifier for a multiclass dataset. My model achive a 78.8% accuracy, which was the second highes out of all the course student.
